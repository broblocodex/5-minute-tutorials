## Disappearing Bridge — study links

Short and useful. Go deeper after you try the script.

- TweenService + TweenInfo: https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/TweenService
- BasePart (Transparency, CanCollide): https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/BasePart
- BasePart.Touched: https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/BasePart#Touched
- RemoteEvent: https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/RemoteEvent
- Attributes: https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/Instance#Attributes

Patterns you’ll reuse:
- Fade with TweenService; wait() until Completed
- Per-character debounce using a table
- Broadcast state changes to clients for VFX/UI
