# Magic Jump Pad — 5‑minute tutorial

Step on the pad. It launches you up. Simple physics, instant fun.

## What you’ll build
- A Part that launches any player who touches it.
- Starts simple. Then add variations (cooldown, direction, sound, remote hooks).

## Files in this tutorial
- [script.lua](./script.lua) — the simplest version (start here)
- [steps/](./steps) — incremental checkpoints aligned to use-cases (01 → 02)
- [wiki.md](./wiki.md) — hand‑picked Roblox docs links
- [use-cases.md](./use-cases.md) — 4 quick ideas to apply it

## Try it (2 minutes)
1. Insert a Part.
2. Put a Server Script inside.
3. Paste `script.lua`.
4. Step on it in Play mode.

## Then explore (3 minutes)
- Walk through `steps/` in order:
    - 01 cooldown → 02 forward-mode (set MODE = "forward")

## Which step for which use-case?
- Start gate pop → `script.lua`
- Cooldown gate → Step 01 (cooldown)
- Forward fling → Step 02 (forward-mode)
- Combo with speed strip → `script.lua` (strip is separate snippet)
