## Roblox Short Mechanics
Four tiny mechanics. Open → copy → paste → tweak.

## How to follow along

These aren't full-blown tutorials - they're more like quick recipes. Each one takes maybe 5 minutes to get working, then you can mess around with the values to see what breaks (or what gets cooler).

Tutorials
- [1. Chameleon Block](video1/) — events + state
- [2. Jump Pad](video2/) — physics impulse
- [3. Teleporter](video3/) — CFrame placement
- [4. Spinning Platform](video4/) — tween loops
- [5. Random Walker NPC](video5/) — pathfinding + animation
- [6. Animated Melee Combo](video6/) — melee animations + combat polish

Each folder includes
- script.lua (complete working code)
- readme.md (quick tutorial), wiki.md (key APIs), use-cases.md
- steps/ folder (code broken into stages)

Quick start
1) Pick a folder above.
2) Open script.lua and paste it into a Part.
3) Play and tweak one number.
